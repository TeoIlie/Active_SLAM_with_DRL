# PIC4rl_gym_platforms
This repo contains the gazebo simulation packages of the robotic platforms used for the pic4rl_gym project:
https://github.com/PIC4SeR/PIC4rl_gym


## Description of the project
The PIC4rl_gym project is intended to develop a set of ROS2 packages in order to easily train deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous navigation in a Gazebo simulation environment. A great variety of different sensors (cameras, LiDARs, etc) and platforms are available for custom simulations in both indoor and outdoor stages. Official paper of the project: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10193996. Please consider citing our research if you find it useful for your work, google scholar reference at the bottom.


**Tested software versions**
- ROS 2: Foxy (Ubuntu 20.04), Humble (Ubuntu 22.04)
